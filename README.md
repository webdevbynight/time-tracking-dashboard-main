## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (via SCSS)
  - custom properties
  - logical properties
  - flexbox
  - grid
- JavaScript (via TypeScript)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt the way of building a grid layout with the keyword `auto-fit`. I thought it would be complicated to use it, but it is as easy as to use the `repeat()` function, where such a keyword is used. Combined with the use of the `clamp()` function to define the grid container width, I managed not to multiply media queries.
